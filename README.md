# my-first-portfolio

THis was my first ever mock portfolio website created in my basic web design class. For this portfolio I used HTML5, CSS3 and a bit of JQuery implementation to bring it to life.  

It was not meant to be live, just meant to showcase my knowledge and understanding of HTML5 and CSS3.
